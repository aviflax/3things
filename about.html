      <h1>About “Three Things”</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p>Three Things was inspired by Jeff Atwood’s post <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/three-things/">Three Things</a>, which is short and sweet, so please do read it.</p>
      <p>Three Things isn’t about keeping track of anything. It’s about asking yourself, every morning, “What three things do I need to do today?” That’s why it starts up every morning with a blank slate. It’s not about dragging things around or choosing from a backlog. It’s about the mental exercise of clearing your mind and asking yourself “what’s really important today”?</p>
