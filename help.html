      <h1>Just 3 Things? Really?</h1>
      <p>
        Yes, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        To really understand why Three Things is limited to just 3 things, I recommend you read
        Jeff Atwood’s post <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/three-things/">Three Things</a>,
        which is short and sweet and inspired this app.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a nutshell: Three Things isn’t about capturing all the hundreds of things you need to do.
        It isn’t about tracking a bunch of tasks or even making a to-do list for your day. It’s
        about going through the exercise, <em>every day</em>, of asking yourself what your main
        goals or tasks or areas of focus are, <em>for that day</em>. It’s about a <em>practice</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why three specifically? It just feels right. I guess Jeff can balance three things during a
        given day, and not four — and I’ve found this to work for me as well. Four just feels like
        too many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three Things may not be for everyone. If it doesn’t work for you, that’s fine — feel free
        to not use it, or to modify it for your own purposes. I made it for
        <a href="http://aviflax.com">me</a> — and it’s working for me. I’m only sharing it on the
        off chance that it might work for you too.

        <li>On Mac OS X and Windows: <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a></li>
        <li>On iOS: Safari works just fine

      <h1>Using Three Things while Offline</h1>
      <p>If you’re using Safari for iOS; Chrome for Mac, Windows, or Linux; or Internet Explorer for Windows then Three Things works great when you’re offline.</p>
      <p>Before you do, you just need to open the app once when you’re online; after that you should be able to access it using its normal URL even when you’re offline.</p>

          <td>Chrome 35</td>
          <td>Seems to work!</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Safari 7</td>
          <td>Seems to work except for offline support.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Firefox 30</td>
          <td>Seems to work except for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=591737"><code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></a>.</td>
